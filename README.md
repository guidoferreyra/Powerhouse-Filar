# Powerhouse Filar

Powerhouse Filar is the house typeface of the Powerhouse Museum, the largest museum group in Australia. It is inspired by the museum’s vast collection of objects, specifically its extensive array of typewriters, analog rulers and the largest concentration of specimens from F.T. Wimble’s Australian Type Foundry. Powerhouse Filar was commissioned with the intention of becoming a collection object itself and reinforcing the Museum as a living, breathing and permeable institution, the typeface is available here under the SIL Open Font License.

Powerhouse Filar is a family made up of 4 duplexed weights in roman and italic across 5 unitisation logics, Proportional, Octo, Quarto, Trio and Mono.

Across four unitisation logics, the typeface moves from the even texture of a proportionally spaced font to one that employs only eight possible letter widths (Octo), four possible widths (Quarto), three possible widths (Trio) and finally a conventional monospaced font. This creates a curious spectrum between text with an even colour to something more like data, from letters to be absorbed to letters to be parsed.
